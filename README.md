### backend-data-science-II-final-project

#Note:
This project is not built with virtual environment due to some hardware issue that this project this being built on. (will wipe clean my pc soon)
Because of that, this project relies on the globally set libraries only.

The libraries needed are:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
flask
